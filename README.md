# 👋 Hi, I'm SmileLulz

I'm an indie game developer passionate about making simple, fun, and replayable games that anyone can enjoy. I focus on small-scope, simple gameplay with a minimalist aesthetic. My current projects are cuurently available for Android only, with plans for iOS and PC in the future.

🎮 I create:
- Pixel-art or low-asset games with clean mechanics
- Single-player experiences — multiplayer may come later!
